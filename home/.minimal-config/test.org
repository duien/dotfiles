* This is an org file to test things
** TODO This is a basic todo item
** DONE This is a done item
* These test cases have [[http://example.com][links]]
** TODO Here is a [[http://example.com][link to test]] on a todo item

* Some additional investigation
The face for links is =org-link= and it doesn't set anything itself, just inherits from =button=
The face for what I'm calling verbaitm is =org-code= (I always get those two revered) but either way, both those faces set foreground and background and inherit from =modus-themes-fixed-pitch=

Leuven seems to have the same issue, so maybe it's really an org issue not a modus issue.

org version 9.5.?
