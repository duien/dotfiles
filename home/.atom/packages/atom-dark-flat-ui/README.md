# Atom Dark/Flat UI theme

Fork of Atom's default dark UI theme, but with flat tabs.

This theme is installed by default with Atom and can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.

If you prefer less space between tabs, add that to your `style.less`:

```css
.tab-bar .tab {
  margin-right: 1px;
}
```
