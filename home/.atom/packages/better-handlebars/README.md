# Better Handlebars for Atom

![handlebars-syntax](https://github.com/WMeldon/better-handlebars/raw/master/example.png)

Syntax is a mostly vanilla conversion of [Sublime Handlebars](https://github.com/daaain/Handlebars),
but with a few fixes.  

Scope properties mostly stolen from [Atom language-html](https://github.com/atom/language-html).

### Improvements:

  * ```ctrl-/``` yields ```{{!-- --}}```
  * Snippets for most common Handlebars blocks
  * Block highlighting more specific
