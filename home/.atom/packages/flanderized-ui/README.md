# Flanderized

Outlander is a dark, flat UI theme for [Atom](https://atom.io/).
Flanderized combines the elegant simplicity of [Outlander](https://atom.io/themes/outlander-ui) with the tranquil-yet-vivid
colorset we call [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) Dark.

Best used with the Solarized Dark syntax theme that comes included with Atom.
Well, that's what I like to use it with. You have to live your own life. Make
your own choices. Decide what's best for **you**. And sometimes I won't agree.
Even if I'm right, I still have to let you make your own mistakes.

## Installation
Run the following in a terminal:
```sh
$ apm install flanderized-ui
```
Alternatively, the theme can be installed from the settings menu at **_preferences -> themes_**, from where the theme itself can also be applied.

## To Do
* Fix selected file highlighting being interrupted by scroll bar in tree view
* Change remaining gray areas to a more Solarized-compatible shade.
* Decide whether I'm comfortable with a UI theme that changes the color of the
  gutter and selection, which is more of a syntax decision.

#### What's with the name?
An excellent question. <strong>F</strong>ork of Out<strong>lander</strong> incorporating Sola<strong>rized</strong> = **Flanderized**

It's also a reference to the TV Tropes concept of [Flanderization](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization).
