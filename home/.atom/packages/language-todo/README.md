# TODO support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting to `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `CHANGED` in comments
and text in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [TODO TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/todo.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
