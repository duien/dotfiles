# AngularJS support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to AngularJS in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [AngularJS TextMate bundle](https://github.com/angular-ui/AngularJs.tmbundle).

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
